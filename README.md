# MERN ToDo Application 📝

This is a full-stack ToDo web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The project was developed as part of the DevTown Full Stack Bootcamp, and showcases everything I’ve learned about full-stack development using the **Monostack** approach.

## 🌟 Features

### ✅ User Authentication
- Secure **Sign Up** and **Login** system.
- Passwords are hashed using **bcryptjs**.
- Uses **JWT tokens** for session handling and secure routes.
  
### 🗂️ Task Management
- Add new tasks with default status and priority.
- Delete tasks individually.
- Mark tasks as **Completed** or **Pending**.
- Update task **Priority** (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
- **Edit** existing tasks directly from the UI.
- Filters to sort tasks by **status** and **priority**.
- Tasks auto-sort based on **priority**, showing high-priority tasks first.

### 🎨 Modern UI
- Built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Smooth interactions with hover effects and transitions.
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop.

### 🌐 Deployment
- Backend hosted on **Render**.
- Frontend hosted on **Vercel**.

## 📚 What I Learned from DevTown

Through the DevTown Full Stack Bootcamp, I learned:

### 👨‍💻 Full Stack Development (Monostack Approach)
- How to design and build a full-stack project from scratch.
- Structuring backend routes and controllers.
- Connecting backend APIs to a MongoDB database securely.
- Creating user-friendly and efficient React components.
- Handling state using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

### 🔐 Authentication and Security
- Using `bcryptjs` for hashing passwords.
- Implementing JWT for secure authentication and route protection.

### ⚙️ Deployment & CI/CD
- Deploying backend and frontend apps using Render and Vercel.
- Debugging deploy-related issues such as version conflicts and environment setup.

### 🌐 Real-world Project Structure
- Proper folder organization for scalability.
- Writing clean and maintainable code.
- API integration using `fetch` (alternatively can use Axios).
